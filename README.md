# autohooks-plugin-isort

[![PyPI release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/autohooks-plugin-isort.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/autohooks-plugin-isort/)

An [autohooks](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks) plugin for Python code
formatting via [isort](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort).

## Installation

### Install using pip

You can install the latest stable release of autohooks-plugin-isort from the
Python Package Index using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):

    pip install autohooks-plugin-isort

Note the `pip` refers to the Python 3 package manager. In a environment where
Python 2 is also available the correct command may be `pip3`.

### Install using pipenv

It is highly encouraged to use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for
maintaining your project's dependencies. Normally autohooks-plugin-isort is
installed as a development dependency.

    pipenv install --dev autohooks-plugin-isort

## Usage

To activate the isort autohooks plugin please add the following setting to your
*pyproject.toml* file.

```toml
[tool.autohooks]
pre-commit = ["autohooks.plugins.isort"]
```

By default, autohooks plugin isort checks all files with a *.py* ending. If only
the imports of files in a sub-directory or files with different endings should
be sorted, just add the following setting:

```toml
[tool.autohooks]
pre-commit = ["autohooks.plugins.isort"]

[tool.autohooks.plugins.isort]
include = ['foo/*.py', '*.foo']
```
